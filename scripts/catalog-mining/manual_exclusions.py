"""Permanent blocklist of specific offer URLs/links that must never be
re-added by any future mining run, regardless of source (Awin, Rakuten,
eBay). Distinct from the regex-based EXCLUDE_RE in extract.py, which
filters by TEXT PATTERN across many products -- this file is for
one-off bad listings the user identified by hand (wrong brand, low-
trust dropship photo, unlicensed replica) that don't share a reusable
pattern with anything else in the catalog.

Match by a stable substring of the link (eBay item id, or a store's
product-slug), not the full URL, since affiliate tracking params can
change between mining runs.
